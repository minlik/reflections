What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Each version has its logical meaning, and you can easily find the 
          difference between two version.
    Cons: You may forget to commit on some changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is for programmers. Different files are usually closed connected.
    Google Docs is an online tool and people may change one file at one time.

could break something?
